# visRepresentation

visEmergeFigure.ipynb is the main function. This repo only has the code to plot the panels, and does not have the extraction code for creating the pkl files from raw files. 
The analysis folder which has the pkl files for plots is in the **Qnap/Hatilgan/visRepresentation/analysis **
Please change the **newPathForAnalysis** (line 36) for the analysis folder.
